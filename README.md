# Build-My-Own-Redis
A simple Redis-like server built in Java. Why? I am building this application to strengthen my knowledge of core Java concepts and socket programming. This project helps me understand how network servers work, how to handle multiple client connections with threads, and how to implement basic protocol parsing in Java.
