# Build-My-Own-Redis
A Redis-like in-memory key-value store built in Java.
This project is part of my journey to master core Java concepts such as socket programming, multithreading, and protocol parsing. It simulates basic Redis functionality and helps me understand how network servers manage client connections and interpret communication protocols.
